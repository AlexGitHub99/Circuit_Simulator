Circuit Simulator

Left Mouse Button - select items from menu and place
Right Mouse Button - edit resistance and voltage
"R" - rotate component
"-" - zoom out
"+" - zoom in

Notice: Circuit simulator can find
resistance, voltage and current for only
ONE BATTERY circuits.

Any combination of series and parallel
will work, however wheatstone-bridge 
type circuits will not work.

The ammeter can be placed in any part
of the circuit and will find current.

The voltmeter can be placed in any part
of the circuit and will find voltage,
(if you want to find the voltage accross
a resistor, you must connect it in parallel
with that resistor.)
